Angular directive slider control.

**No JQUERY dependency needed anymore**

Welcome to a fork from awesome job of Egor Khmelev https://github.com/egorkhmelev/jslider

Why
-------------

Original implementation provides very nice features but too much for my needs, this one just simplified.

Source files were divided in several files, and not angular integrated.

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-slider.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-slider.min.js"></script>
```
in case you want to use your own template, omit the last line and instead add some template code
to your project:
```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="aw-select.tmpl.html">
    ....
</script>
```

Then, inject `ngSlider` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngSlider']);
```

and then just add an `input` with `slider` directive name attribute, `value` and `options` scope variable attribute.

```html
<input ng-model="value" type="text" id="mySlider1" slider options="options" />
```

'value' your slider scope end value, as string.
'options' slider scope options value as json.
'ng-disabled' angular common attribute.

```javascript
$scope.value = "10";
// $scope.value = "10;15"; FOR DOUBLE VIEW
```

### Options

Options for your slider in json format {from:.....}

* `from`: start value
* `to`: end value
* `step`: step value
* `dimension`: string, example " $"
* `scale`: array for scale
* `round`: how many numbers allowed after comma
* `smooth`: true/false; false snaps the button to value
* `vertical`: true/false; vertical slider, default false
* `css`: hash object 
* `realtime`: triggers changes and model update on every moves
* `threshold`: minimum distance allowed between 2 pointers, default both pointers overlap 


![angular slider css](http://darul75.github.io/ng-slider/images/slider2.png "angular slider css explained")
```
css: {
	background: {"background-color": "silver"},
	before: {"background-color": "purple"},// zone before default value
	default: {"background-color": "white"}, // default value: 1px
	after: {"background-color": "green"},  // zone after default value
	pointer: {"background-color": "red"}   // circle pointer
	range: {"background-color": "red"} // use it if double value
}
````
* `callback` : function triggering current value, can be useful

```javascript
// example
callback: function(value, released) {
	// useful when combined with 'realtime' option
	// released it triggered when mouse up
	console.log(value + " " + released);
}
```
