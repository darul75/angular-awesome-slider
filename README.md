=====================

Angular directive slider control.

Welcome to a fork from awesome job of Egor Khmelev https://github.com/egorkhmelev/jslider

Why
-------------

Original implementation provides very nice features but too much for my needs, this one just simplified.

Source files were divided in several files, and not angular integrated.

It takes me time to make it works and all jquery code is included in directive, I do not know if it is the best thing to do today ;)

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-slider
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note sanitize module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-slider.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-slider.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngSlider` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngSlider']);
```

and then just add an `input` with `slider` directive name attribute, `value` and `options` scope variable attribute.

```html
<input ng-model="value" type="text" id="mySlider1" slider options="options" />
```

'value' your slider scope end value, as string.
'options' slider scope options value as json.
'id' attribute, put different if several slides on same page.

```javascript
$scope.value = "10";
// $scope.value = "10;15"; FOR DOUBLE VIEW
```

### Options

Options for your slider in json format {from:.....}

* `from`: start value
* `to`: end value
* `step`: step value
* `dimension`: string, example " $"
* `scale`: array for scale
* `round`: how many numbers allowed after comma
* `smooth`: true/false; false snaps the button to value


### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
